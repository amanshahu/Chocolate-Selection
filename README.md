1.Front-end Framework: React

Justification: React is a popular and widely-used JavaScript library for building user
 interfaces. Its component-based architecture allows you to create reusable UI components,
 making the codebase more modular and maintainable. React's virtual DOM ensures efficient
 updates, which is important for a dynamic interface like the one you're building.
 React's state management also simplifies handling user selections and updates.

2.Styling: CSS 

Justification: Using plain CSS gives you full control over styling your interface. 
To streamline styling and maintain consistency, consider integrating a CSS framework 
like Bootstrap. Bootstrap provides responsive and pre-styled components that can be 
easily customized to match your design. It also offers a grid system, which is helpful 
for responsive layouts.

3.JavaScript

Justification: JavaScript is essential for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to 
your interface. It enables you to handle user interactions, update data in real-time, 
and create a more engaging user experience. JavaScript is also a core part of React 
development and is used to manage state and trigger UI updates.
